### How do I approach designing software?

**New Design Skills**: This project has significantly honed my skills in texture mapping, shader programming, and lighting techniques. I learned how to apply multiple textures in a single shader and use transformation matrices effectively. 

**Design Process**: My design process involved initial planning, iterative development, and continuous testing. I began with basic geometric shapes to model the spacecraft and gradually added details and textures. Lighting was incorporated to enhance realism, and the scene was continuously refined based on feedback and testing.

**Future Application**: The iterative design approach, combined with continuous testing and refinement, can be applied to future projects to ensure high-quality outcomes. This method ensures that the final product is both functional and polished.

### How do I approach developing programs?

**New Development Strategies**: In developing the 3D scene, I utilized multiple development strategies, such as modular programming and effective use of libraries for model loading. I also implemented camera controls for user interaction, enhancing the overall experience.

**Iteration**: Iteration was crucial in my development process. Each iteration allowed me to refine the scene, fix bugs, and improve performance. This continuous loop of development and testing ensured a robust final product.

**Evolution of Approach**: Throughout the project milestones, my approach evolved to become more structured and disciplined. Initially, I focused on getting individual components to work. As the project progressed, I emphasized integration and optimization, ensuring that all parts worked seamlessly together.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

**Educational Pathway**: Computational graphics and visualization have equipped me with new knowledge and skills that are essential for advanced courses in computer science. These skills will be beneficial for projects involving complex data visualization and interactive simulations.

**Professional Pathway**: Professionally, the ability to create realistic 3D models and environments is valuable in fields such as game development, virtual reality, and architectural visualization. The project has also improved my problem-solving skills and my ability to work with advanced graphical techniques, which are highly sought after in the tech industry.

## Conclusion

This project has been an enriching experience, allowing me to apply a wide range of skills in computational graphics and visualization. The iterative design and development processes I followed have not only enhanced the quality of my work but also prepared me for future challenges in both educational and professional settings.
